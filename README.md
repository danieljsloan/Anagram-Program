# Anagram-Program
User inputs strings into two text boxes, upon clicking the "Test" button the program checks if the textbox values are the same. If so, then the program outputs "These strings are anagrams". If not, it then checks if the textbox values are the same length. If not, then then the program outputs "These strings are not anagrams". If so, two strings are initialized to be the text box values. These strings are then converted to CharArrays and all uppercase letters are converted to lowercase letters. These arrays are then sorted via the Array.Sort(); command (which is quicksort). Two new strings are created to be the values of the sorrted CharArrays. A final check is implemented to check if the two new strings equal one another. If so, then the program outputs "These strings are anagrams". If not, then the program outputs "These strings are not anagrams".
